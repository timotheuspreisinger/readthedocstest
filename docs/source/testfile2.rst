==========

We have more to say here, 
and even link the :doc:`api` page or another chapter, 
e. g. :ref:`Installation` or :ref:`A smaller Headline` or 
:ref:`my-reference-label`.

Chapter headlines have to be written in lower case and with dashs 
replacing spaces. :ref:`A smaller headline` is not working.

.. _my-reference-label:

A smaller headline
